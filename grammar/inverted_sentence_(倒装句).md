## 概述

倒装句实际上就是谓语前置句, 它主要用于以下几种形式:

- 疑问句
- 状语前置
- 虚拟语气



谓语前置的规则主要有两种:

1. 前置谓语.
2. 前置助动词, 如果没有助动词, 那么补上助动词 do 后再前置.

从阅读的角度来看, 没必要清楚每种规则的使用场景, 只要能顺利把倒装句还原成正常句子就行.



## 疑问句

示例:

- What can he do?

    → [还原助动词] What he **can** do?

    → [还原疑问代词] He can do **what**?

- Does he like swimming?

    → [还原助动词] He **does** like swimming?

    → [删除补充的助动词] He **likes** swimming?



## 状语前置

示例:

- Here comes he.

    → [还原谓语] Here he **comes**.
    
    → [还原状语] He comes **here**.
    
- Never will I trouble you again.

    → [还原助动词] Never I **will** trouble you again.

    → [还原状语] I will **never** trouble you again.

有时, 还可能前置多个状语, 例如:

- Never before had he been to this restaurant.

    → [还原助动词] Never before he **had** been to this restaurant.

    → [还原两个状语] He had **never** been to this restaurant **before**.

there be 句型是状语前置的一种特殊形式, 其中, there 是形式状语, 真正的状语在句子末尾. 例子如下:

- There is a book on the desk.

    → [替换形式状语] **On the desk** is a book.

    → [还原谓语] On the desk a book **is**.

    → [还原状语] A book is **on the desk**.



## 虚拟语气

例句:

- Had I known, I would have helped him.

    → [补上 if] **If** had I known, I would have helped him.

    → [还原助动词] If I **had** known, I would have helped him.

- Should he decide to come, please telephone.

    → [补上 if] **If** should he decide to come, please telephone.

    → [还原助动词] If he **should** decide to come, please telephone.
